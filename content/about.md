Substrait, LLC is a company that makes software to help active stock traders and investors grow their capital. We make web-based tools such as [Wash Sale Advisor](https://washsaleadvisor.com) and we are working on more. We also plan to release our Substrait app platform that will enable other developers (and non programmers) to create tools for investment finance.
